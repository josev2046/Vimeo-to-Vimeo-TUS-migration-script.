# Vimeo-to-Vimeo-TUS-migration-script.
This prototype automates video migration between folders in two separate Vimeo accounts. This process is distinct from an official transfer, which preserves video URLs and IDs and is managed via Vimeo Support. The script downloads assets temporarily, then uploads them using the TUS protocol.
